This is just my code for some problems of acm and project euler.

I was not sure how many of them I can keep in mind. Maybe I kept their code but forgot what they said.

Maybe read them once more will never happens. If I can't get rid of past, I can't create a future.

What's my future plan?

Nothing is impossible.But I can predict and promise anything now.
