# program challenges 

以下几个网站的练习:
1. xmu acm
2. poj
3. project euler
4. checkio
5. python_challenge
6. topcoder
7. hacker rank
8. code eval
9. codility

是多了点，反正做着好玩的。

I was not sure how many of them I can keep in mind. Maybe I kept their code but forgot what they said.

Maybe read them once more will never happens. If I can't get rid of past, I can't create a future.

What's my future plan?

Nothing is impossible.
